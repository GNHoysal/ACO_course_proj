# ACO_course_proj

Run ACO_proj_script.m in matlab.

Note: Re-run the code if it throws any errors. The values for the sparse matrix entries are sampled from Guassian distribution. This might cause the errors in computing the string convexity parameter. The code triggers eroors and stops execution in such cases.
